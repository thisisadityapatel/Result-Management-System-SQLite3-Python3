# Result-Management-System-SQLite3-Python3
Python was used to create the programme, and the SQLite3 database was used to store the data. The primary goal of this project was to learn SQLite3 Database Implementation in Python. The applications are modelled around a school result declaration management system, where students may connect with their student identity and password and access their results online. Teachers and school administration can log in separately using unique credentials and add, edit, and delete student information from the school database.
